# Introduction
Uber Data Analysis is a Python project that aims to gain insights from Uber ride data. Uber Technologies, Inc. is a prominent American technology company known for its ride-hailing services and other offerings.

The primary objectives of this analysis are to answer questions like:

How long do people typically travel with Uber?
What are the most common hours for taking Uber rides?
What are the main purposes of Uber trips?
Which days and months see the highest number of trips?
Where do most people start their Uber journeys?

# Requirements
Before running the analysis, make sure you have the necessary libraries and datasets. In this project, the following libraries are used:

pandas
numpy
datetime
matplotlib
seaborn
The dataset used for this analysis is "Uber Drives - .csv," which should be loaded into the project directory.

# Data Cleaning
The first step in the analysis involves checking and handling missing values in the dataset. Missing values are dropped in this project, but it's essential to note that there are other methods to deal with missing data.

# Data Analysis
The analysis includes several key sections:

Checking the distribution of trip distances.
Determining the most common hours for Uber rides.
Analyzing trip purposes.
Identifying the days with the highest number of trips.
Visualizing the number of trips per day and month.
Investigating the most common starting points for Uber journeys.

# Results
The project reveals insights into Uber ride data, such as the most common hours for trips, the purposes of rides, the days with the highest trip numbers, and more. These findings can be valuable for Uber in understanding user behavior and optimizing their services.
